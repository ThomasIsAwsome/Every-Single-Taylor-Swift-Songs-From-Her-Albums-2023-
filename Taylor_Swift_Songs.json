(Huh)I can reclaim the landAnd I miss you (I miss you)But I miss sparkling (ah, hey)Best believe I'm still bejeweledWhen I walk in the roomI can still make the whole place shimmerAnd when I meet the bandThey ask, \"Do you have a man?\"I can still say, \"I don't remember\"Familiarity breeds contemptDon't put me in the basementWhen I want the penthouse of your heartDiamonds in my eyesI polish up real, I polish up real nice NiceSapphire tears on my faceSadness became my whole skyBut some guy said my aura's moonstoneJust 'cause he was highAnd we're dancin' all nightAnd you can try to change my mindBut you might have to wait in lineWhat's a girl gonna do?A diamond's gotta shineBest believe I'm still bejeweledWhen I walk in the roomI can still make the whole place shimmer (shimmer)And when I meet the bandThey ask, \"Do you have a man?\"I can still say, \"I don't remember\"Familiarity breeds contemptDon't put me in the basementWhen I want the penthouse of your heartDiamonds in my eyesI polish up real (nice), I polish up real nice And we're dancin' all nightAnd you can try to change my mindBut you might have to wait in lineWhat's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do? I polish up niceBest believe I'm still bejeweledWhen I walk in the roomI can still make the whole place shimmer"
